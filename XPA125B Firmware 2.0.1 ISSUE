I tested the new firmware 2.0.1 for the XPA125B with this package.  I found the following issues:

1 - When selecting the 15 meter band the relays in the XPA125B click rapidly forever
2 - When selecting the 12 meter band, when I key the PTT the amplifier changes to 15 meters even though the radio is on 12 meters
3 - When selecting 10 meters or 6 meters the band does not change to the correct one and stays on 12 meters or goes to 12 meters

I verified that the voltages for band switching matched those in the user manual
When I revered back to 2.0.0 Build 0.14 everything started working again

1/27/2025 UPDATE:
I checked the voltages from the TTGO unit into the amplifier, this time with the cable to the amplifier attached.  Turns out the amp is drawing down the voltages.
I adjusted the voltages in software with the amp attached in release 1.4.4 and tested with builds 2.0.0 Build 0.14 and the new 2.0.1 build and everything is now working.
I can only guess that this new firmware release was coded with tighter voltage ranges than the previous releases.
If upgrading to version 2.0.1 of amp firmware make sure to use version 1.4.4 of the TTGO build or later
